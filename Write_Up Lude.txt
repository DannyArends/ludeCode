Determine cell type specificity vectors

Samples per cell types Affy GPL570:

Whole Blood - 244 samples
Neutrophil  - 204 samples
Bcell       - 396 samples
Tcell       - 157 samples
nkCell      - 47 samples
RBC         - 30 samples

Calculation of cell type vectors

We calculate the cell type vector using a basic student T-test between each gene the expression level in cell samples 
versus the whole blood samples. This results in a vector (of length probes) of scores signifying the difference in 
expression between the cell type of interest versus whole blood
-> Results see table00.tab

Using correlation to check the concordance between the expression on Affy GPL570 and RNAseq using correlation. This 
shows high correlation between similar celltypes on the different platforms, while it shows less correlation with 
unrelated cell types.
-> Results see table01.tab

Cell type vectors on different platforms

We were unable to calculate vectors from the seven available RNA seq cell type samples (NK, Bcell, Monocytes, Tmemory, 
CD4, CD8, Granulocytes) where no whole blood was available. We used the pooled expression the other 6 cell types (to 
represent 'whole blood') and then use a ratio to have vectors we can correlate with our GPL570 cell type vectors.
-> Results see table02.tab (not yet there)

To estimate the stability of our vectors we calculated correlation between cell type vectors obtained using the 
Affymetrix platform (HG-U133A) to a comparable illumina platform (GPL6102). this results shows a positive correlation 
between related celltypes across platforms, while unrelated cell types tend to show a no or a negative correlation.
-> Results see table03.tab

Cell type vectors and SNP:QTL interaction term matrix

The resulting vectors are then correlated against all the qtl*celltype interaction vectors (calculated by meta 
analysis HarmJan at all significant QTL). When we detect a correlation above 0.XX between a celltype vector and a 
QTL:Interaction vector we can confidently assigning a cell-type specific 'label' to the detected QTL.
-> Results see table04.tab
