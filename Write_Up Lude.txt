Determine cell type specificity vectors

CellTypes Affy GPL570:

Whole Blood - 244 samples
Neutrophil  - 204 samples
Bcell       - 396 samples
Tcell       - 157 samples
nkCell      - 47 samples
RBC         - 30 samples

We calculate the vector using a basic student T-test between the cell samples and the 
whole blood samples. This results in a vector (of length probes) of scores signifying 
the difference in expression between the cell type of interest versus whole blood. The 
resulting vectors are then correlated against all the qtl*celltype interaction vectors 
(calculated by meta analysis Harm jan at all significant QTL).

When we detect a correlation above 0.XX between a celltype vector and a QTL:Interaction 
vector we can confidently assigning a cell-type specific 'label' to the detected QTL
